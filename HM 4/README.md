## Online Movie System
Design the system of the application that sells or rents movies online.

- Movies can be listed in the application, sorted, and users can subscribe to the application.
- Users purchase credits through the system for subscription.
- Only users who subscribe can rent movies with their credits and the credit cost of the movie they rent is deducted from their account.
- Regular users and subscribers can buy movies.
- If the movie is not available, it can be requested.

Draw a Class diagram depicting this system.
