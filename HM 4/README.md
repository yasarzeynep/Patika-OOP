## Flight Management System
Design a system for the management of flights and pilots.

- Airline companies operate the flights. Every airline has an identity.
- The airline company has different types of aircraft.
- The aircraft may be in operation or in a state of repair.
- Each flight has a unique ID, the airport where it will take off and land, departure and landing times.
- Each flight has a pilot and co-pilot, and they operate the aircraft.
- Airports have unique identities and names.
- Airline companies have pilots, and each pilot has an experience level.
- An aircraft type may require a certain number of pilots.

Draw a Class diagram depicting this system.
